# JT DeepSeek V3 integration

This family constructs a complete HF-derived causal JT model before optional
acceleration. It has its own `JTDeepseekV3Config`, `JTDeepseekV3ForCausalLM` and
lazy adapter registration. The standard `deepseek_v3` family is independent.

## Ownership

| Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `configuration.py` | Reference configuration validation and HF field mapping |
| `modeling_jt_deepseek_v3.py` | Complete decoder, causal MLA, MoE routing/combine, residual precision, public MTP construction and objective |
| `adapter/conversion/` | Checkpoint mapping, MLA projection implementation and JT MTP execution policy |
| `adapter/distributed/` | Bind model-owned expert semantics to Hyper EP dispatch and communication |
| `adapter/policies/` | Declarative parameter sharding roles |
| `adapter/runtime/` | Retained alignment optimizer and logical parameter views |
| `adapter/jt_builder.py` | Build, optionally replace, strictly load weights and apply Hyper infrastructure |
| `recipes/jt_deepseek_v3.yaml` | Replacement, parallel layout and runtime component selection |

The model directly constructs dense/shared experts, routed experts, norms and an
executable public MTP. The recipe replaces Attention with `JTDeepseekV3MLAAttention`
and selects `JTDeepseekV3MTPExecution` at `mtp.execution`. The latter is required
for JT MTP precision parity; it does not add missing prediction depths.

## Reusable DeepSeek MTP

`hyper_parallel/components/modules/mtp.py` provides `DeepseekV3MTP`: independent
fusion norms/projections/decoders, sequential future-token and target shifts,
shared embedding/head calls, and weighted multi-depth cross entropy. Another
family supplies its decoder and can use the complete algorithm directly:

```python
from hyper_parallel.components.modules import DeepseekV3MTP

mtp = DeepseekV3MTP(
    hidden_size=config.hidden_size,
    num_layers=config.num_nextn_predict_layers,
    decoder_factory=build_causal_decoder,
    rms_norm_eps=config.rms_norm_eps,
)
result = mtp(
    trunk_hidden, input_ids,
    embedding=model.embed_tokens,
    head=shared_output_head,  # The main model's output norm and vocabulary projection.
    labels=next_token_labels, loss_mask=next_token_mask,
    loss_factor=0.3,
    decoder_kwargs=attention_arguments,
)
loss = main_lm_loss + result.loss
```

The factory receives the zero-based depth and returns a causal decoder with a
Tensor output. V3/V3.2 decoders can implement different attention while reusing
the same MTP orchestration. Embedding/head modules are passed by reference at
forward time, so their parameters are not registered twice. Labels are already
shifted once for the main LM objective. Each row is one complete sequence;
packed-document boundary handling and context-parallel shifting are unsupported.
The default CE divides by the original token count, as in V3 paper Eq. 24;
a custom loss callback can provide masked or vocabulary-parallel reduction.

`adapter/conversion/jt_mtp.py` subclasses the public execution component and
changes only fusion precision and recurrent-state selection: embeddings are
rounded before normalization, both normalized branches are fused in BF16, and
normalized prediction states are carried between depths. JT also supplies its
norms/decoder, per-depth output normalization and existing masked vocabulary loss.
The public default carries the raw decoder state and lets the shared head own
output normalization.

The execution module is parameter-free and is a sibling of `mtp.layers`, allowing
its replacement in the same plan as Attention inside MTP layers without nested
replacement targets. Existing `mtp.layers.*` checkpoint and sharding paths are
preserved. This composition reuses optimized child kernels; it is not a new fused
MTP kernel, and no MTP speedup is claimed without performance measurement.

## Training entry

Use the existing common Trainer entry with explicit local assets:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 examples/training_demo/train_text.py \
  hyper_parallel/models/jt_deepseek_v3/recipes/jt_deepseek_v3.yaml \
  --model.reference_yaml=/path/to/reference.yaml \
  --model.reference_weights=/path/to/initial_weights \
  --dataset.data_path=/path/to/supervised_prefix
```

The retained alignment recipe requires a batch of one full 262144-token sequence,
TP8/EP8/SP and DP/CP/PP1, FP32 parameters and BF16 compute. It loads matching
exported initial weights; it does not download assets. Its optimizer owns the
reference gradient synchronization, clipping and update schedule. Other
parallel topologies, performance gains and checkpoint continuation are not
established by this recipe's regression test.

The common entry calls `TextTrainer.train()`. No model-specific launcher or
train/evaluate branch is added. Setting `train_iters: 1` still executes a training
step, including backward and update; it does not select evaluation-only behavior.

## Public supervised data and loss adapter

The recipe uses `IndexedSupervisedDataset`, the shared `FixedBatchDataLoader`,
and `TextParallelBatch`. There is no model-owned dataset or batch implementation.
A data prefix identifies three aligned standard Megatron indexed streams:

| Stream suffix | Stored content | Batch dtype |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.tokens.bin` / `.tokens.idx` | Complete input token records | int64 |
| `.labels.bin` / `.labels.idx` | Already shifted targets, including ignored labels | int64 |
| `.loss_mask.bin` / `.loss_mask.idx` | Explicit nonnegative supervision weights | float32 |

All streams must have matching record lengths and document boundaries. The
Dataset preserves record order; DataLoader sampling determines training order.
This is a supervised extension using the public indexed reader, not a claim
that a token-only GPT corpus contains instruction supervision automatically.
No extra token is appended and no labels are reconstructed. Fixed-size records
must contain the configured full 262144-token sequence.

`preserve_loss_mask: true` selects the shared batch path that preserves explicit
weights through CP slicing and TP broadcast, including fractional weights.
The default public text batch still derives its binary mask from labels.
The recipe uses compressed attention metadata and does not build a quadratic
256K attention mask. The model accepts public `shift_labels`, `loss_mask` and
`position_ids` directly. `shift_labels` is mandatory and is never shifted again;
`labels` remains available for Trainer bookkeeping. `ModelComputedLoss` forwards
supervision under the same field names with `pass_loss_inputs: true` and reads
the complete objective without masking auxiliary terms or scaling gradients.
There is no model-owned data reader or loss adapter.

LM and MTP use Hyper's shared vocabulary-parallel CE with per-token outputs.
JT retains its explicit mask, normalization epsilon and ordered sequence sum.
The shared CE returns global per-token losses on every vocabulary rank, with
one local-shard derivative. It does not multiply gradients by TP size.
The former model-owned CE backward and total-objective gradient division are
removed together.

MoE auxiliary values are means of equally sized token partitions. The shared
`model_parallel_mean` reduces their forward values and differentiates each
local contribution once. Its output is one logical replicated loss, not several
independently consumed objectives; this is distinct from an autograd all-reduce
that sums every replica's upstream derivative. This boundary does not alter LM
or MTP gradients. Other partition sizes/topologies need explicit token weighting.

The public-loss refactor changes floating-point evaluation and backward order.
Earlier ten-step equality is historical evidence for the archived implementation,
not an accuracy claim for this revision. The new 256K TP8/EP8 regression is run
separately after publishing the review changes.

## Per-step loss and QK-clip metrics

The common `LoggingCallback` consumes optional `get_logging_metrics()` hooks on
its model and optimizer once per optimizer step, on every rank. Providers own
any distributed reduction; rank zero prints at `training.logging_steps` cadence.
These detached observations are not entries in the Trainer backward loss dict.

JT reports `training/lm_loss`, `training/mtp_loss`, and `training/aux_loss`.
MTP and auxiliary values include the configured coefficients; the objective is
`(lm_loss + aux_loss) + mtp_loss`. Values are microbatch means for the supported
TP-replicated, DP1/CP1 recipe (one microbatch per step).

The optimizer captures `optimizer/qkclip_maxlogits/<module path>` before QK-clip
clears the attention statistic, then takes the maximum across TP head shards.
`optimizer/qkclip_maxlogits` is the maximum across all participating attention
modules, including the MTP decoder. These are the attention statistics used by
QK clipping, not vocabulary logits or maxima recomputed after clipping. Only
scalar snapshots and a packed TP MAX reduction are added; attention matrices
are not retained for logging. Terminal scalar formatting uses nine significant
digits so FP32 loss differences remain visible.
