    For each sequence, ``f_i`` is the fraction of routed slots assigned to expert
    ``i`` and ``P_i`` is the mean over its tokens of each token's affinities
    normalized across all ``E`` experts; the loss is averaged over the sequences.
    Unlike the top-k-weight load-balance loss of
    :class:`~hyper_parallel.components.modules.moe.MoE`, ``P_i`` uses the affinities
    of every expert.

    When the sequences are partitioned across ``sequence_partition_group``, ``f_i``
    is averaged over the group and the returned loss is the group mean replicated
    on every rank, each rank differentiating only its own tokens. Unlike the
    per-rank partial value of the MoE load-balance loss, this value is complete on
    every rank, so it can be reported and added to a replicated objective.

    Args:
        scores: Router affinities of every expert, ``[..., tokens, num_experts]``,
            for example sigmoid scores before top-k selection; leading dimensions
            index independent sequences, and a 2-D input is one sequence.
        selected_experts: Selected expert indices, ``[..., tokens, top_k]``, with the
            same leading dimensions as ``scores``.
        coeff: Aux loss coefficient.
        sequence_partition_group: Optional process group whose ranks hold different
            token shards of the same sequences; ``None`` keeps the statistics local.
